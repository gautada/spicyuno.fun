# spicyuno

This is the repository for all things spicy uno. 

## Legal Stuff

This is **NOT** [Mattel's](https://www.mattel.com) card game [*UNO*](https://www.amazon.com/Mattel-Games-UNO-Retro-Editon/dp/B07DDJNHFF/ref=sr_1_4?crid=X3NNAOJV5JAY&keywords=uno+classic&qid=1666374231&qu=eyJxc2MiOiI0LjA1IiwicXNhIjoiMy41NyIsInFzcCI6IjMuNTEifQ%3D%3D&sprefix=uno+classic%2Caps%2C123&sr=8-4), although you need a deck to play.

## Website

[spicyuno.fun](http://www.spicyuno.fun) hosts the content of this site for public consumption.

## Rules

The rules of spicyuno are documented in [Base Spicy Uno Rules](...). These rules should be thought of as the atrting point for your own spicyuno. The [base rules](...) may change over time and should be considered as the bottom line.  In the event of a rule conflict or dispute then the latest [base rules](...) should take prescedent over customized rules.

### How do I propose a new rule?

Well... currently there is not a way, it is totally possible and that is the goal of the [spicyuno.fun](http://www.spicyuno.fun) project.  Please stay tuned for more information.
